CPU-bound
Programs which are compute-intensive, i.e. where the program execution requires very high utilization of the CPU (close to 100%), are called CPU bound programs. 
I/O-bound
Such programs spend most of their time waiting for input or output operations to complete while the CPU sits idle. I/O operations can consist of operations that write or read from main memory or network interfaces.
