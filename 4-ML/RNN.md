# 1. Notation
$X^(i)<t>:$ $t^{th}$ element of $i^{th}$ training example  
$T_{X}^(i):$ length of input sequence for the ith training example  
$Y^(i)<t>:$ $t^{th}$ element of $i^{th}$ training example   
$T_{Y}^(i):$ length of output sequence for the ith training example  

# 2. Basics
Why not standard NN: (1) input output can be different in different examples (2) Doesn't share feature learnt across different positions of text
